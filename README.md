# nuclear plants big dataset
## Project Description

This project is divided into two main sections:
### Section I: Data Summary, Understanding, and Visualization

In this section, we aim to gain insights into the provided dataset of pressurized water reactors, a type of nuclear reactors. The dataset contains various measurements taken in different parts of the reactor, including vibration, pressure, and power levels. The first column in the spreadsheet indicates the status of the reactor, whether it is 'normal' or 'abnormal'. All the other columns represent features that could potentially help us understand the status of each reactor better.

### Section II: Classification & Big Data Analysis

In this section, we delve deeper into the dataset to perform classification and big data analysis. Our goal is to determine if the features provided in the dataset can be used to predict whether a reactor is normal or abnormal.
### Dataset Overview

  Dataset Name: nuclear_plants_big_dataset
  Dataset Contents: Pressurized water reactor data including various measurements and reactor status (normal or abnormal).

### Approach

  Data Exploration: We will explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and the distribution of data.
  Data Visualization: Utilizing visualization techniques to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the reactor status.
  Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for analysis.
  Classification Models: Implementing classification algorithms to predict the reactor status based on the provided features.
  Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the classification models and analyzing the results to draw conclusions.

### Future Steps

  Explore advanced machine learning techniques for better prediction accuracy.
  Optimize feature selection and model parameters.
  Perform additional analyses to uncover deeper insights into the dataset.
